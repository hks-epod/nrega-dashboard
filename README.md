### MGNREGA Dashboard


MGNREGA Dashboard, which was launched by the Secretary of Rural Development through a video conference to relevant state officials on August 29, 2014. The Report Dashboards are an intuitive interface that provide administrators with real-time visualized summaries of program performance at all administrative levels (GP, block, district, state, and central). They provide administrators with a birdâ€™s eye view of MGNREGA implementation, highlighting bottlenecks and problems as they arise and in context of previous performance.
